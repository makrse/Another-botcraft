# An Attempt of Re Imagine Mindcraft üß†‚õèÔ∏è

Taking the original proyect and followed updates as inspiration and re asemble with my own vision.
The main objective its to be affordable to general people that cannot spend to pay keys and limitation of tokens to be more public friendly in few clicks.
I'm a hobbist self-learned knowledge about coding but still cannot consider as a trully code self-sufficient Developer since I get some help from own bots, so be aware that my code probably will be very messy so forgive me if in any case i do poorly code, and forgive me if my english expression its not very clear, since its not my first mother language.

#### ‚ÄºÔ∏èWarning‚ÄºÔ∏è
Do not connect this bot to public servers with coding enabled. This project allows an LLM to write/execute code on your computer. While the code is sandboxed, it is still vulnerable to injection attacks on public servers.
